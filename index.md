# Quantum Corona

Targetted drug design against SARS-CoV-2 using Physics; starting with transition state analogue inhibitors against the 3CL-Protease. 

Anyone with Gaussian (or equiv.) experience, and knowledge of intermolecular forces, transition-state searches etc. is very welcome to join in. Get in touch!

The intent is to provide design hints to medicinal chemists, and also to produce structures directly to the [@CovidMoonshot](https://twitter.com/Covid_Moonshot). 

Everything will be open-science / pre-printed / shared as produced.
